<h1>Space Mines</h1>

<p>A relatively simple implementation of Minesweeper in "space" or with 3 dimensions.</p>

<p>You will see 3D formation of dull gray orbs on a darker background.  These are potential mines.  You can move
amongst them without risk of setting them off.  Much like the 2D version, you can click on locations where you
suspect there is NOT a mine.  If you click on an orb that does NOT contain a mine, it will either disappear or
change color to something more appropriate to its proximity to an actual mine (see below).

<h3>Blowing Up (aka "Failing")</h3>

<p>If you do accidentally select an orb that contains an active mine, the mine field will be revealed with all active
mines appearing a bright red.  At this point you can refresh your browser to try another game at the same difficulty or
come back to this index page and select a different difficulty level link below.</p>

<h3>Orb Colors</h3>

<p>As mentioned earlier, if you click on an orb that does not contain an active mine it will disappear or change to a
color that gives a hint to as many active mines it is adjacent to.</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Color</th><th>Number of adjacent active mines</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Blue</td><td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Green</td><td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Yellow</td><td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Orange</td><td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Red</td><td>5 or more</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3>Getting Around</h3>

<p>This games uses Three.js FlyControls.  Use your arrow keys or mouse drag to look around.  W, S, A, D, R and F to move around.
G and E can be used "roll" left and right respectively but these are of limited value for this situation.  Here is a
more detailed table of controls:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Control</th><th>Action</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>W</td><td>Move forward</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>S</td><td>Move backwards</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>A</td><td>Move left</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>D</td><td>Move right</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>R</td><td>Move up</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>F</td><td>Move down</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Q</td><td>Roll left</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>E</td><td>Roll right</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3>Marking Active Mines</h3>

<p>As you locate orbs that you suspect are active mines, right-click or cntrl-click on them to "mark" them as
suspected active mines.  They will turn bright white when marked.  Once you have "marked" all the active mines
successfully, all the orbs that are not mines will disappear and only the correctly marked active mines will
remain.  If you see the non-active orbs disappear and only your marked mines remain, you have beaten that board.</p>


<h3>Difficulty</h3>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Difficulty</th><th>Dimensions</th><th>Number of active mines</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a target="_blank" href="game.html?difficulty=easy">Easy</a></td><td>4x4x4</td><td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a target="_blank"  href="game.html?difficulty=average">Average</a></td><td>4x4x4</td><td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a target="_blank" href="game.html?difficulty=hard">Hard</a></td><td>5x5x5</td><td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a target="_blank" href="game.html?difficulty=very">Very Hard</a></td><td>5x5x5</td><td>5</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3>Restarting a New Game</h3>

<p>To restart a new game at the same difficulty level, simply click your browser's refresh button.  To try a
different difficulty level, navigate back to this index page (e.g. "http://twcrone.com/space-mines").</p>

<h3>Code</h3>

<p>The code for this game is currently stored in Github <a href="https://github.com/twcrone/space-mines">here</a>.</p>

<p>The game relies on Three.js and sample code from <i>Learning Three.js - The JavaScript 3D Library for WebGL</i>
written by Jo Dirksen.

your best bet is send me a tweet that you sent me some email so I'll know to look for it.</p>
